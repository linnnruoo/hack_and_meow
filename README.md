# Hack & Meow
> 

This is a simple website that allows users to look at cat photos, and submit their own favorite photos of cats! We use image recognition to verify that the uploaded image is a cat before the user can submit them along with their name and captions. These names and captions are also parsed and meow-ified before submission.
It works better on mobile <br>
